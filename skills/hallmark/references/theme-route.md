# Design flow · Step 2.6 — Theme route

Moved verbatim from `SKILL.md` § Design flow. The studied-DNA / custom / catalog dispatch. The full custom protocol lives in [custom-theme.md](custom-theme.md).

### 2.6. Theme route — studied-DNA, catalog, or custom

By the time you reach this step, one of four things is true:

0. **A `study` diagnosis was emitted earlier in this conversation and the user is asking to build from it** (phrases: *"build it"*, *"make it"*, *"use this DNA"*, *"build with this"* — immediately following the diagnosis) → theme route is **studied-DNA**. **Skip catalog/custom dispatch entirely.** The studied paper OKLCH, accent OKLCH, type roles (with named candidates), macrostructure, and nav/footer archetypes from the diagnosis become the locked system for this build. Diversification is suspended — you're following an external DNA, not rotating the catalog. The Step 6 stamp records `theme: studied-DNA (source: <URL or image>)` plus the actual OKLCH/font values inline. **If the user later pivots with phrases like *"use Newsprint instead"* / *"ignore the DNA"* / *"rotate to a different theme"*,** route back to the normal dispatch below and resume diversification. Continue to Step 3.
1. **The user named custom** (because they said so, or because Step 1's signal detection fired and they confirmed) → load [`references/custom-theme.md`](custom-theme.md). For a **tuned** custom: ask the **one** follow-up (vibe in 4–8 words + optional anchor colour), construct the OKLCH palette + free-font pairing, compute the three axis values (paper-band / display-style / accent-hue). If the brief's **structure itself** is the ask (signal 5 — "from scratch / no theme", or a page-shape no catalog macrostructure fits), take the **bespoke** depth instead: design the palette, type, **and** structure from first principles (custom-theme.md § Bespoke depth). **Every slop-test gate still fires either way.** Then continue to Step 3.
2. **The user named catalog** (or implicitly accepted it by not naming custom) → pick one of the 21 named themes per the diversification rule above. Existing flow — continue to Step 3.
3. **Neither was discussed** (Step 1's signals didn't fire — vanilla brief) → default to **catalog**. Do not pause. Do not ask. Continue to Step 3.

**Custom is a quiet branch, not a default question.** Most briefs route to catalog and the user never sees the words "catalog" or "custom." The 21 named themes plus the rotation rule already deliver structural variety; the fork is reserved for when the brief specifically asks for a tuned look the catalog can't carry.

A custom theme is a **complete** OKLCH palette + font pairing tuned to the brief — not a one-off colour swap, not an excuse to bypass the rules. Every constraint in [`color.md`](color.md), [`typography.md`](typography.md), and [`anti-patterns.md`](anti-patterns.md) still applies. The 58 slop-test gates fire unchanged. The Step 5 preview block surfaces the palette + pairing in plain text **before** any code is emitted, so the user can redirect.

The diversification rule is theme-route-blind: a custom run that follows another custom (or a catalog) must differ on at least one of the three axes from the previous entry, same as catalog-vs-catalog. Custom entries record their three axes explicitly into `.hallmark/log.json` (see [`custom-theme.md`](custom-theme.md) § F).
